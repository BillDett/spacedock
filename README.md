Wall width is a concern- need to make consistent- and has a real effect on the rotated arcs...how to address this? What is best wall size for printing?

Overall Spacedock model doesn't quite fit together (neck and shoulders)- we must have the shoulder height calculation wrong still...

Need to give some thought to internal structure too- do we need internal supports? How about hole/connector for a mounting rod?
