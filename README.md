Wall width is a concern- need to make consistent- and has a real effect on the rotated arcs...how to address this? What is best wall size for printing?

Need to make some consistency for each part's initial location and how we then stack into the final product. Need to be able to render the whole thing as well as individual parts for printing.

Need to give some thought to internal structure too- do we need internal supports? How about hole/connector for a mounting rod?
